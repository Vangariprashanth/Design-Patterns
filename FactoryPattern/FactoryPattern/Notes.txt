Factory pattern is used when we create a object based on a condition.
    Lets say there are 100 classes and we need to create an object based on one condition in 100 classes, then the same below code is used in all classes. 
    This leads to duplicacy of the code to avoid this we will create the Factory pattern.
    The condition: 
        if (condition is true){
                create an object // if this condition is present in all the 100 classes then there is a duplicacy of the code.
        }
